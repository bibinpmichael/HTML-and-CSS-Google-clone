<!-- 
The <html> tag serves as the root element of the HTML document, encapsulating all other elements within it. This tag is essential as it defines the document as an HTML5 document, allowing browsers to interpret and render the content correctly.

Within the <head> section, we find a single <link> tag. This tag is crucial as it connects our HTML file to an external CSS file named "styles.css". By separating our styles into a separate file, we adhere to the principle of separation of concerns, making our code more maintainable and easier to update. This approach also allows for better caching by browsers, potentially improving load times for returning visitors.

The <body> tag contains all the visible content of our page. Within the body, we have a single <div> element with the class "main". This div serves as a container for all other elements, allowing us to easily center and arrange the content as a cohesive unit.
Inside the main div, we have three primary elements:

            An <img> tag with the class "logo-img", which displays the Google logo.

            An <input> tag with the class "search-input", representing the search bar.

            Another <div> with the class "btn-wrapper", containing two <button> elements for "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky".

This structure closely mirrors the layout of the actual Google search page, focusing on the essential elements that users interact with most frequently.
